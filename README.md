#Analysis on attitudes toward transportation issues according to people's living situations
Traffic safety, highway congestions, price of traffic and etc, these traffic problems impact people’s daily life significantly. This report hypothesizes that people’s attitudes toward some traffic issues have relations to their households situation, driving behavior, and travel trends. 

This study used the 2009 The National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) conducted by U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Regression models between respondents’ traffic issue concern degree and their demographic conditions, households information, travel behaviors were built. Six traffic issues were studied. They are safety concerns, highway congestion, price of travel, aggressive/distracted drivers, access or availability of public transit, lack of walkways or sidewalks. And significant relations were found between population’s attitudes to some issues and their economic conditions, travel behavior.

For the methodology, six logistic regression models were built and principal component analysis was conducted as well.
